            ask you for more detailed demographic information that will help us get to know you better. You should
            expect to be at your appointment for at least 2 hours, though often it is faster.</h5></div>

        <div class="eight columns"><h5>Should we need to dilate your pupils, you should expect that your vision will be blurry for 4-8 hours. You
            should not drive to your appointment. <strong>We strongly suggest having someone drop you off and pick you
                up from the Waterfront Eye Institute</strong>. The wait will be at least 30 minutes to see the doctor while your
            pupils are dilating. Due to unscheduled emergencies, especially when we are on-call, the wait may be
            longer.</h5></div>

        <div class="four columns"><h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Tests</h4></div>
        <div class="eight columns"><h5>While you are waiting to see the doctor, our technicians may perform tests that will help the doctor
            diagnose and manage your condition. We have state-of-the-art machines including optical coherence
            tomography, non-invasive optical coherence tomography angiography, wide field imaging,
            autofluorescence, B-scan ultrasonography, automated visual fields, biometry, and advanced corneal
            biomechanics.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Manitoba Health does not cover all of these tests and there are fees associated with some. Depending
on why you are visiting you may have all, some, or none of these tests. Our staff will be there to answer
your questions and walk you through your experience.

        <div class="eight columns"><h5>You will be brought into an exam room where our technicians will measure your visual acuity,
            intraocular pressure, and ask you some basic health questions. The doctor will see you next. They will
            take a detailed history, ask you questions, and thoroughly examine your eyes. After the examination, the
            doctor will explain your diagnosis and therapeutic options. They will take the time to answer any
            questions you might have. The doctor will then send a letter to your referring doctor’s office to update
            them with the plan.</h5></div>

            scheduled at Waterfront Eye Institute. Some procedures may happen immediately following your
            consultation. If you require eyedrops before your procedure, you will be notified of this when the
            appointment is booked. If you require surgery, it will be booked at one of the surgical sites our surgeons
            work at.</h5></div>

            appointments/tests you may require, book surgery, provide you with letters or forms, or direct you to a
            lab for blood work or to an imaging department.</h5></div>
